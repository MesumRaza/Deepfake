# Running the notebook:
<ol>
  <li> Open 'Deepfakes.ipynb' and click on open in google colab.</li>
  <li> Change runtime to GPU from CPU.</li>
  <li> After installing streamlit by running the first cell, you will have to restart run time of the notebook.</li>
  <li> After importing original open source repo, change the order of files as shown below to follow along with the notebook.</li>
  <li> You can else refer to https://colab.research.google.com/github/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model/blob/master/demo.ipynb#scrollTo=SB12II11kF4c</li>
  <b>[Note</b>: You will have to upload source video and destination image through google colab as streamlit currently does not have a direct way to accept and process videos.]
